The file command_file.txt was different in main and b1 branches as both had modified it and main had pushed those changes. 
main branch had the first statement as [[[edited from main branch]]]
b1 branch had the first statement as (((edited from b1 branch)))

this created a conflict while merging as main had pushed its changes
we resolved the conflict by opening the file in vim editor and changed the first statement into: 
""""merge conflict resolved"""

now this copy of file went to both the branches, thus solving the conflict.
then we committed and pushed the file from main branch
